# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation hub for OctoAcme’s project management processes. This README provides both an overview of how projects are run at OctoAcme and a directory of links to all process documents in this folder.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme employs a structured, role-driven approach to project management that supports clear ownership, iterative delivery, and transparent stakeholder engagement. Every project begins with a well-defined initiation process, where success metrics, timeline, stakeholders, and business needs are crystallized in a Project One-pager. Once greenlit, initiatives move into planning, with work broken into shippable increments, explicit acceptance criteria, risk registers, and release milestones. Each project role—Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, and QA—has well-defined responsibilities, contributing to detailed planning and maintaining clear documentation.

Project execution is steered by agile team rhythms: daily standups, weekly deliverable syncs, and regular demos. Project boards (using GitHub Projects or equivalents) visually track work across states like Backlog, In Progress, QA, and Done, with strong pull request practices ensuring code quality and accountability. Automated and manual tests, security scanning, and issue-based development keep product delivery robust and responsive.

Communication is central: regular status updates, risk escalations, templated incident reports, and aligned standup/retro cadences ensure everyone is informed and empowered. Stakeholder communication is clear and proactive, reducing friction and surfacing blockers early. Continuous improvement forms a feedback loop, with frequent retrospectives and tracked action items driving process adaptation and learning.

Through this cycle of thoughtful planning, disciplined execution, robust quality assurance, and ongoing reflection, OctoAcme supports repeatable project success and effective institutional knowledge sharing.
